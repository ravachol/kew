## Installing

<a href="https://repology.org/project/kew/versions"><img src="https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/kew.svg" alt="Packaging status" align="right"></a>

Install through your package manager or homebrew (macOS). If you can't find it on your distro, or you want the bleeding edge, follow the [Manual Installation Instructions](docs/MANUAL-INSTALL-INSTRUCTIONS.md).

## Usage

kew creates a playlist with the contents of the first directory or file whose name matches the arguments you provide in the command-line.

```bash
kew cure great
```

This creates and starts playing a playlist with 'The cure greatest hits' if it's in your music library.

It works best when your music library is organized this way:

artist folder->album folder(s)->track(s).

### Example commands

```
kew (starting kew with no arguments opens the library view where you can choose what to play)

kew all (plays all songs, up to 20 000, in your library, shuffled)

kew albums (plays all albums, up to 2000, randomly one after the other)

kew moonlight son (finds and plays moonlight sonata)

kew moon (finds and plays moonlight sonata)

kew beet (finds and plays all music files under "beethoven" directory)

kew dir <album name> (sometimes, if names collide, it's necessary to specify it's a directory you want)

kew song <song> (or a song)

kew list <playlist> (or a playlist)

kew theme midnight (sets the 'midnight.theme' theme).

kew shuffle <album name> (shuffles the playlist. shuffle needs to come first.)

kew artistA:artistB:artistC (plays all three artists, shuffled)

kew --help, -? or -h

kew --version or -v

kew --nocover

kew --noui (completely hides the UI)

kew -q <song>, --quitonstop (exits after finishing playing the playlist)

kew -e <song>, --exact (specifies you want an exact (but not case sensitive) match, of for instance an album)

kew . loads kew favorites.m3u

kew path "/home/joe/Musik/" (changes the path)

 ```

To set a theme from the command-line, run:

```bash
kew theme <themename> (ie 'kew theme midnight')
```

Put themes in \~/.config/kew/themes (\~/Library/Preferences/kew/themes on macOS).

## Visulizations / Chroma

You can add visualizations to kew by installing Chroma:

https://github.com/yuri-xyz/chroma

These are enabled when a song doesn't have a cover.

You can also enable and cycle through them by pressing 'c'.
